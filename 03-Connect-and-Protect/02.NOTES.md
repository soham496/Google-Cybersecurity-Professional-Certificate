# Notes – Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security  

## Networking Basics
- Internet works by connecting devices through routers, switches, and ISPs.
- IP Address = unique number given to devices. (IPv4 and IPv6)
- DNS = like a phonebook of the internet (converts domain → IP address).

## Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS: Used for websites. HTTPS is secure with encryption.  
- FTP: File transfer protocol  
- SSH: Secure shell (remote login)  
- DHCP: Gives devices an IP address automatically.  

## OSI Model (7 layers)
1. Physical – cables, hardware  
2. Data Link – MAC addresses  
3. Network – IP addressing  
4. Transport – TCP/UDP  
5. Session – managing connections  
6. Presentation – data formats (encryption, compression)  
7. Application – user-level protocols (HTTP, DNS, etc.)  

## Security Concepts
- Firewalls: block/allow traffic  
- VPN: secure tunnel over the internet  
- Proxy: middle server for requests  
- IDS/IPS: detect and prevent attacks  

## Tools
- Wireshark: packet analysis  
- Nmap: port scanning, service detection
