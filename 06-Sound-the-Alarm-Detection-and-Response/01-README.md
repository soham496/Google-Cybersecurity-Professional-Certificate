Course 6 – Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response 

This course focused on detecting and responding to security incidents. I learned about the incident response process, using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and file hash analyzers, and how to investigate suspicious activity.

📂 Projects Completed
1. Incident Handler’s Journal 📓
Recorded security incident entries.
Documented 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why) for real-world scenarios.
Practiced writing clear, structured notes for response reports.

2. Research on Network Protocol Analyzers 🌐
Compared Wireshark and tcpdump.
Listed similarities and differences in functionality.
Learned when to use each tool during network monitoring.

3. Investigate a Suspicious File Hash 🔍
Used the Pyramid of Pain to understand attacker behaviors.
Analyzed whether a file hash was malicious.
Learned how hashes fit into incident detection.

✨ Key Learnings

How to detect, analyze, and respond to suspicious activity.
The importance of documentation during incident handling.
Using different tools for network traffic analysis.
How to think like an incident responder in real scenarios.
