Vulnerability Assessment Report
7th September 2025

System Description
The system being analyzed is a Linux-based database server. It has a strong hardware setup with a modern CPU and 128 GB of RAM. The server runs the latest Linux OS and hosts a MySQL database. It uses IPv4 for communication and is connected to other systems on the network. Security features currently in place include SSL/TLS encryption for connections, but there are still some gaps in access control.
Scope
This vulnerability assessment focuses on the access controls of the database server. The analysis covers a period of three months (July 2025 – September 2025) and follows the guidelines from NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for risk assessment
Purpose

The database server is critical for the business because it stores important customer and operational data.


If the data is not secured, it could lead to data breaches, loss of customer trust, or legal issues.


If the server goes offline, employees won’t be able to access customer records or perform key business operations, which could result in loss of revenue and productivity.

Approach
I analyzed the system by focusing on how data is stored, accessed, and secured. I checked the risks of unauthorized access, weak authentication, and misconfigurations. For each risk, I thought about the likelihood of it happening and the impact on the business if it did.
Remediation Strategy
To reduce risks, I recommend the following:
Authentication & Authorization


Enforce strong password policies.


Use role-based access control (RBAC) so users only get the access they really need.


Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).


Encryption


Replace outdated SSL with TLS 1.2 or higher for secure data transfer.


Network Security


Use IP allow-listing so only company devices/networks can connect.


Close unnecessary ports to reduce the attack surface.


Auditing


Enable database logging and monitoring to track suspicious activities.


Regularly review accounts and disable inactive users.
