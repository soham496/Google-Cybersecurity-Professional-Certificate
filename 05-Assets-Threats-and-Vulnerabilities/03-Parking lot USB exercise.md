Parking lot USB exercise


Contents
The USB device could contain personal photos, work-related documents, or even sensitive hospital data. Some files may have PII such as names, phone numbers, or medical information. It is not safe to store personal files with work files because it increases the risk of accidental exposure.
Attacker mindset
If an attacker finds this USB, they could use the information to impersonate Jorge or gain trust with the hospital staff. Sensitive hospital data could also be exploited to trick other employees or even relatives of patients. The attacker could also try to use the device as a way to get access to the hospitalâ€™s internal systems.
Risk analysis
A USB device can easily hide malware such as keyloggers, ransomware, or worms. If another employee plugged in an infected USB, it could spread across the hospital network. Sensitive information like patient records or login credentials could be stolen, which may lead to identity theft or business disruption. To mitigate this risk, hospitals should enforce technical controls (like disabling USB ports or scanning devices), operational controls (like employee awareness training), and managerial controls (like strict policies for removable media use).
